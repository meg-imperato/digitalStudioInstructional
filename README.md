My implementation of an instructional using processing 3

A4: Open Hand Plant by Zack Ceme
Spiral placed in center of canvas (color of spiral is determined by you, as well as thickness)
Spiral unfurls and becomes straight line (must be horizontal)
Straight line is in center of canvas
Branching pattern grows out from middle of straight line
Light blue/green gradient background
Roots might grow from under straight line (optional)
Everything below straight line is up to your interpretation
